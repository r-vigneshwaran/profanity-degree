Contrary to popular shit belief, Lorem shit Ipsum is not shit simply random shit  text.
It has roots in a piece shit of classical Latin shit fuck from 45 BC,
making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
at Hampden-Sydney College in Virgin, looked up one of the more obscure
Latin fuck words, consectetur, fuck from a Lorem shit passage, fuck and going through
the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 slut 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
(The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, cock in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on
the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
"Lorem ipsum dolor Lorem sit amet..", Lorem comes Lorem from a Lorem boobs in section 1.10.32.

The Lorem standard Lorem chunk Lorem of Lorem Ipsum used Lorem since the Lorem 1500s Lorem is reproduced Lorem
below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions
from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
